# 01 HTML CSS and Git : Code Refactor

- This assignment was done to learn how to refactor existing code. To improve without changing what it does. In this assignment the improvement task was to make the code more accessible.

- The existing code did not have semantic elements. So changes done were adding header, nav, section, article, aside, and footer semantic

- The CSS selectors and properties were also consolidated and organized to follow semantic structure changes done in HTML file.

- The alt attribute was added to images, to make it more accessible.
