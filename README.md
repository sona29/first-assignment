# 01 HTML CSS and Git : Code Refactor

- This assignment was done to learn how to refactor existing code. To improve without changing what it does. In this assignment the improvement task was to make the code more accessible.

- The existing code did not have semantic elements. So changes done were adding <header> <nav> <section> <article> <aside> <footer> semantic elements
